# Python by Topics

This repository contains Python examples and exercises organized by topic.  
It is designed for practice and reference while learning Python concepts.

Each file contains simpleexamples to demonstrate key Python concepts.

## Learning Source
I followed the [Chai Aur Code](https://www.youtube.com/@ChaiAurCode) Python series to learn the concepts and practice examples. This repository is my personal collection of exercises based on that series.
